- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fadi Makarem.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating intelligent software to solve difficult tasks. I love machine learning; but I think human knowledge with machine learning is essential to find effective solutions (No Free Lunch Theorem).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning something new. The world is full of interesting ideas and problems to solve.
- :hearts: I enjoy game development. Although, lately I have not had enough time for it :cry:.
- :soccer: I like sports, especially football.
